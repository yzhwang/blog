Hello! I'm a self-taught front-end developer, passionate about *JavaScript, UNIX Systems & Open Source projects*.

I do *WordPress, HTML5/CSS3* handcoded sites and some *jQuery/JavaScript* stuff.

I enjoy to learn new stuff about web technologies and build my own tools... (when I can), so I've released most of them on my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/thinkxl), you can see a list and short description of each one [here](/projects.html).

In my free time I like to:

- Read about economy, graphic & interior design, Internet security, productivity, startups, games, mangas & Linux 
- Learn other languages like python & C
- Play Xbox with my son
- Watch movies and sleep late with my wife
- Take snapshots with my [hipster camera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosina_CT-1)
- Make lists
